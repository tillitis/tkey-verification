.SH NAME
.PP
A program to verify the identity of a Tillitis TKey.\&
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBtkey-verify\fR -h/--help
.PP
\fBtkey-verify\fR [--base-url url] [-d | --base-dir] [--port port] [-u | --show-url] [--speed speed]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBtkey-verify\fR is a program to verify the identity of a Tillitis TKey.\&
.PP
To use, first insert a TKey and then run the command.\& If one is
already running a TKey program, remove it and re-insert before running
the program.\&
.PP
Options:
.PP
\fB--base-url\fR url
.PP
.RS 4
Set the base URL of verification server for fetching verification
data.\& Default is "https://example.\&com/verify".\&
.PP
.RE
\fB-d\fR | \fB--base-dir\fR directory
.PP
.RS 4
Read verification data from a file located in directory
and named after the TKey Unique Device Identifier in hex, instead of
from a URL.\&
.PP
.RE
\fB--port\fR port
.PP
.RS 4
Path to the TKey device port.\& If not given, autodetection will be
attempted.\&
.PP
.RE
\fB-u\fR | \fB--show-url\fR
.PP
.RS 4
Only output the URL to the verification data that should be
downloaded, then exit.\&
.PP
.RE
\fB--speed\fR speed
.PP
.RS 4
Speed in bit/s of the TKey device port.\&

If you'\&re on a machine without network and need to verify a TKey you
can run
.PP
.nf
.RS 4
$ tkey-verify ---show-url

which will output the URL to the verification file.\& Download the file
using another, networked, computer and somehow bring the file or type
it in again on your airgapped computer.\& Then run:
.PP
.nf
.RS 4

.SH SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
.PP
\fBtkey-verify\fR only verifies the /identity/ of the TKey hasn'\&t changed
since signing by the vendor.\& It might have been manipulated in other
ways.\&
.PP
The device public key isn'\&t published in the verification files but is
retrievable by anyone with access to the device under verification.\&
